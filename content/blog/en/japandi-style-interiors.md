## What Is Japandi Style?

**Japandi style** is a unique combination of two distinct cultures – Japanese zen philosophy and Scandinavian minimalism. It combines simplicity, naturalness and functionality, creating interiors full of harmony that promote rest and tranquility. Japandi delights with subtle colors, organic materials and timeless aesthetics that suit both large spaces and small apartments.

## Key Features of Japandi Style

### 1. Simplicity and Minimalism

Japandi style is based on the principle of "less is more". Interiors are free from unnecessary ornaments and excess items, making the space clear and functional. It's important that every element has its place and purpose.

### 2. Natural Materials

Japandi celebrates closeness to nature. Interiors in this style use wood, bamboo, stone and fabrics such as linen or cotton. These materials introduce warmth and authenticity to the space.

### 3. Neutral Color Palette

Japandi colors are subdued and nature-inspired. Beiges, whites, grays and pastel accents dominate. Subtle contrasts in darker shades, such as olive green or graphite, add depth to the interiors.

### 4. Simplicity of Forms

Furniture and decorations have simple, geometric forms. Characteristic are low tables, beds close to the floor and open shelves that refer to Japanese design.

## How to Furnish an Interior in Japandi Style?

### 1. Invest in Quality

Japandi style focuses on durability and quality. Choose solid furniture made from natural materials. Low coffee tables, wooden shelves and ceramic dishes are excellent choices.

### 2. Add Plants

Plants such as bonsai, succulents or ferns introduce freshness to the interior and emphasize the connection with nature.

### 3. Take Care of Lighting

Japandi interiors require warm, atmospheric lighting. Lamps with paper shades, wooden wall lamps and delicate string lights will perfectly complement the space.

### 4. Personalize the Space

Although Japandi style prefers minimalism, introduce a few personal accents, such as handmade ceramics, photo albums or books.

## Inspirations for Small Spaces
