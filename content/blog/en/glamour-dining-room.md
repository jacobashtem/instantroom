### Light-Tone Arrangement

Use white and beige as a color base, adding metallic accents in the form of gold or silver accessories. Light walls and floors will optically enlarge the space, which is especially important in smaller rooms.

### Color Contrasts

The combination of black and white is a glamour style classic. A black table with a lacquered top and white chairs upholstered in velvet will create an elegant contrast. Complete the arrangement with chrome accessories and crystal elements.

### Colorful Accents

If you like bold solutions, introduce intense colors in the form of chair upholstery or decorations. Deep shades of emerald, purple, or navy will add character to the interior.
