## How to Arrange a Modern Style Dining Room?

### Furniture Selection

- **Table**: the central element of the dining room. Choose a table with simple lines, made of modern materials such as glass, metal, or lacquered wood.
- **Chairs**: ergonomic, with minimalist design. They can be upholstered in fabrics in neutral colors or made of plastics.
- **Storage**: dressers or display cabinets with smooth fronts, often without handles, with push-to-open system.

### Colors and Materials

- **Neutral colors**: white, gray, beige as a base, creating a calm background.
- **Color accents**: can appear in accessories, e.g., in the form of colorful chair cushions or wall decorations.
- **Materials**: combining different textures, such as smooth furniture surfaces, natural wood floors, and metal details.

### Lighting

Lighting in the dining room serves both practical and decorative functions:

- **Main lighting**: pendant lamp above the table, with modern design, can become the central point of the arrangement.
- **Additional lighting**: wall sconces, LED strips, or illuminated shelves will add depth and coziness to the interior.

### Accessories and Decorations

- **Minimalism in decorations**: limit the number of accessories to the necessary minimum.
- **Art**: abstract paintings, graphics, or photographs in simple frames.
- **Plants**: green accents in the form of individual potted plants will add freshness.


## Combining Dining Room with Kitchen or Living Room

In modern arrangements, we often find open spaces where the dining room connects with the kitchen or living room. It's important to maintain stylistic consistency:

- **Consistent colors and materials**: use of the same shades and materials in both rooms.
- **Clear zoning**: use of rugs, differences in lighting, or furniture arrangement to divide space.
- **Functionality**: ensuring free flow between zones and convenient access to all functions.
