## History and Philosophy of Minimalist Style

### Origins and Development

Minimalist style derives from artistic and architectural movements of the 20th century, such as:

- **De Stijl**: Dutch artistic movement from the 1920s, promoting abstraction and reduction of forms.
- **Bauhaus**: German design school focusing on functionality and simplicity.
