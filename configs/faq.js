    question: 'Which styles should I start with? What do you recommend?',
    answer: 'If you are interested in modern visualizations, the best choices are: Scandinavian, economical, refreshed, modern, minimalist, modernist, Ikea.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How does Instant Room work?',
    answer: 'Instant Room lets you upload a photo of your current interior, choose a style and room type, and then redesign it. Generating a visualization takes about a minute, after which you receive photorealistic images of the new interior. The tool is available after registration. To generate one visualization you need one token. After registering you get 5 tokens completely free, without providing a credit card. Test different styles and rooms and then decide if you want to buy more tokens!'
  },
  {
    question: 'What benefits will I get?',
    answer: 'With just a few clicks you can see how your home will look in a given style without paying an expensive interior designer who may charge between 2,000 and 4,000 PLN per room. The visualizations you receive are personalized and matched to the shape and size of your room. You can find inspiration online, but the renders generated in Instant Room can visualize the transformation of your rooms more precisely. This saves you time from browsing hundreds of photos on the internet!'
  },
  {
    question: 'How much does it cost?',
    answer: 'You can check the current price list on the dedicated Pricing page. After registering you will receive 3 visualizations completely free. Try our tool and decide if you want to purchase a token package.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What kind of photos should I upload for the best results?',
    answer: 'For the best results we recommend uploading photos taken straight toward a wall or window. You can also upload angled photos, but they perform worse than straight shots. Make sure the photo is sharp, uncluttered and well lit. Remember that if you upload a photo of, for example, a bathroom and try to generate visualizations for a kitchen, the results may be unsatisfactory.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does it take to generate a room visualization?',
    answer: 'Considering the current processing time, generating one visualization usually takes up to 60 seconds. However, you can generate many visualizations at the same time.\n\nThis time may be longer as it depends on your internet speed, the number of users using the tool and the number of visualizations. If the generation ultimately fails, we will not deduct a token from your account. We only charge tokens for visualizations that are successfully generated.'
  },
  {

  },
  {
    question: 'Can I get a refund?',
    answer: 'Unfortunately, we cannot offer refunds due to marketing and operational costs and the expenses incurred in generating AI images. Our providers do not refund us for the GPU processing time used to generate the AI interior projects. Because of these factors, offering refunds would make our venture unprofitable, so we do not provide refunds unless in justified cases considered individually. When registering you agree to waive the right to a refund for this reason.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Are my data and visualizations safe?',
    answer: 'Yes! Your personal data are stored securely and our system protects them from unauthorized access.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Are my visualizations secure and will they remain my property?',
    answer: 'Yes! The images and graphics you upload and download remain private and are your property. The visual materials you upload are used only to generate the visualizations you request. We will not use them for any other purpose.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can real estate agents use Instant Room?',
    answer: 'Yes, Instant Room allows you to fill empty spaces with furniture while preserving the structure of the room. Simply upload a photo, choose the room type and interior style you want to see in the final result.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Will the images show typical AI artifacts?',
    answer: 'Sometimes yes. Depending on the quality of the uploaded photo and the type of rendered projects, AI artifacts may appear. Any tool using generative AI imaging will contain such artifacts. These can be illogical things like tables with too few legs, two bathtubs, inconsistent structure, etc. However, our experience shows that about 85% of the visualizations will be good enough for inspiration and 15% will be exceptionally good.\n\nWe regularly improve our Instant Room app and prompts to provide a product of the highest quality for our users. Remember that if you are not satisfied with the visualizations, you can try generating them again to get a different result!'
